    "A while back, we created some matrix code using lists (I hope bringing this up doesn't trigger any PTSD from that experience...). These list-based matrices \"work\" in the sense that it is possible for us to construct matrices using lists, and it is possible for us to write code to do calculations with them. We have not yet tried to do any real computation with those tools, however. Doing so will make us regret our choice to implement matrix operations using lists. We will wish that there were a better way to do complex operations without the headaches of checking, rechecking, and worrying about having missed some critical part of the computation in our own code. (Matrix algebra is just a lot of steps, and hard to get right when you're still learning to code.)\n",

This means that we get REALLY fast code, but without the burden of needing to learn more difficult programming languages\n",

Arrays can essentially be treated as equivalent to mathematical matrices (and vectors), and are a special object type that takes data and stores it in formats that allow us to more easily apply mathematical functions to that data. The big advantage of arrays is that the entire array must be of a certain type. If entries in an array are non-numeric, then the whole array is treated as non-numeric (called `object` arrays). If we have some `int` and some `float` values, the array becomes `float`. This allows us to homogenize operations across arrays. \n",
